# KhelaHobe
Project Khelahobe is an online social application where users can create and join groups. Groups can challenge each other to play game based on mutual interest. [Project specification](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Project-KhelaHobe-Spec--AYqL9fIkEkW6XGPeSIDcxh~bAQ-FKa0RW5evbVd96nvyTAb8) will give an overview what we are aiming.

# Project setup

## Download
Get the repository in local machine

`git clone https://github.com/KhelaHobe/Backend.git`

## Setup Python
We will use python 3.7.2 for this project. Ensure that you have already python 3.7.2 installed

`python3.7 --version`

You should create a virtual environmnet (which is a good practice) for this project in the repository directory if specified python version is not your default python.

`python3.7 -m venv env`

(Remember to actiavte the environment before working on)

`source env/bin/activate`

From now on all `python` commands will mean specified python version is being used.
